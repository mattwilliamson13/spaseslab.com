      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.
Pre-requisites     Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.
Set up RStudio Cloud     Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember).</description>

      <title>New Paper: Proximity, politics, and preferences: Spatial and contextual patterns in management opinions for an imperiled multifunctional landscape</title>

      <description>We had a cool paper come out last week. Dr. Haley Netherton-Morrison, a former HES PhD student led an analysis looking at the role of space and familiarity in shaping people’s preferences for addressing sagebrush conservation issues. This was one of the first times we’ve applied Multi-level Regression with Poststratification (MRP) using recruited survey data and Haley did a tremendous job trying to tease out how where we live helps shape our perspectives on how we’d like to see it managed (also she makes great figures).</description>

      <description>Scaling the knowledge obtained from localized case studies to extents and resolutions that match those typically encountered in conservation planning efforts requires identifying recurring patterns in the interactions between people; their local, regional, and national institutions; and the environment. Archetype analysis provides a methodological approach to link the conceptual depth of case studies with the extensive (but often shallow) information in public opinion surveys to characterize these recurrent patterns. Spatial representation of these archetypes can help decision-makers tailor policy and management interventions to the local context while still planning for broader landscape objectives .</description>

      <title>Institutional Resistance and Connectivity Conservation For Wildlife</title>
      <link>https://spaseslab.com/project/resistance/</link>

      <guid>https://spaseslab.com/project/resistance/</guid>
      <description>Conserving species&#39; ability to traverse the landscape is vital for maintaining biodiversity in the face of global change. Connectivity conservation requires identifying important pathways for species&#39; movements and aligning societal support for conservation of those pathways. Contemporary connectivity analyses emphasize the impacts of topography, vegetation and human footprint on species&#39; movements; but largely ignore the role that attitudes, economics and institutions play in practitioners&#39; ability to conserve those movements. Implementation resistance is analogous to biophysical resistance that combines social, economic and institutional factors that promote or impede connectivity conservation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Models of Conservation Occurrence</title>
      <link>https://spaseslab.com/project/occurrence/</link>

      <guid>https://spaseslab.com/project/occurrence/</guid>
      <description>Conservation is both an outcome (preventing species extinction or the loss of ecosystem function) and action that society takes to achieve those outcomes. Years of conservation planning research has been devoted to trying to ensure that we take action in the places the &amp;lsquo;need it most&amp;rsquo;. Despite the fact that individuals, organizations, and nation-states continue to devote resources to conservation (the action), many species and ecosystems remain at-risk (the outcome). We combine datasets describing people, politics, economics, institutions, and the environment with Bayesian spatial models to try and understand the enabling conditions that promote conservation as an action and how their alignment (or not) with ecological priorities affects outcomes for nature and people.</description>

      <title>Intro to Spatial Data in R</title>

      <description>Course Description     Spatial data are ubiquitous and form the basis for many of our inquiries into social, ecological, and evolutionary processes. As such, developing the skills necessary for incorporating spatial data into reproducible statistical workflows is critical. In this course, we will introduce the core components of manipulating spatial data within the R statistical environment including managing vector and raster data, projections, extraction of data values, interpolation, and plotting.</description>

      <title>Building wildfire resilience in underserved communities</title>

      <description>Collaboration has been offered as one of the only pathways to managing the cross-boundary nature of wildfire and building wildfire resilience at scale. By bringing diverse stakeholders together, forest managers can either leverage existing social capital to expedite necessary work or build social capital towards common wildfire goals. Yet collaborative efforts to build wildfire resilience may be socially stratified and opportunistic, privileging specific demographics and locations above others. As such, efforts to build wildfire resilience are misaligned with both social and ecological risk factors.</description>

      <description>Indigenous peoples have been managing ecosystems and species since time immemorial. The practices associated with that management have shaped landscapes and the cultures of the people that inhabit them. Contemporary efforts to restore culturally important species and land management practices are increasingly seen as restorative both for ecosystems and people. Yet, such efforts often must navigate a complex suite of governance arrangements owing to the legacy of settler-colonial land tenure and legal systems.</description>
